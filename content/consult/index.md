### Collaborations
I am open for collaboration with other data-scientists and statisticians. 
If you feel like I can support/assist you in an interesting project just drop me a line!


### Supervision
I also have some experience in supporting students in their statistical analyses part of their thesis and also in providing a fitting study design.
If you need some help as well, let me know and we can plan a meeting together!

I am always looking forward towards new challenges and to help others in their statistical journey.
