 Hi, I am Christoph!
I am a Data Science Consultant at Capgemini Invent, with a background in Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical, and Social Sciences from Utrecht University. My academic foundation was built during my B.Sc. in Psychology at Leuphana University, where my passion for data-driven problem solving first emerged.

Today, my focus lies in developing scalable, real-world applications of data science and Generative AI — especially in enterprise environments. I specialize in cloud-based AI systems (AWS, Azure), Agentic AI (e.g. LangGraph, CrewAI), Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and full-stack solutions from Backend development (e.g. Fast API), Frontend development (Streamlit, ReAct) to deployment (Docker). At Capgemini, I lead cross-functional teams and drive the technical implementation of innovative GenAI applications from ideation to deployment.

Beyond technical delivery, I’m deeply committed to making complex insights accessible — through clear communication, intuitive dashboards, and engaging visualizations.

Previously, I gained experience in managment consulting, market research, and academic research, and remain passionate about interdisciplinary collaboration. Outside of work, I’m an enthusiastic handball coach and player.

Let me know if you'd like a more concise, more casual, or even a bullet-point version — depending on where you want to use it (CV, LinkedIn, website, etc.).
